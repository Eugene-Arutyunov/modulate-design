      Modulate is a frontier voice Al lab which developed a new kind of Al model
      for voice understanding that's 100x faster, cheaper, and more accurate
      than LLMs. Built on our history in the gaming world, understanding highly
      nuanced and emotional conversations, our models can recognize subtle hints
      like sarcasm and truly understand the meaning behind a conversation.
