      Modulate helps with understanding human behavior by analyzing audio
      content. It can be used to analyze customer service calls, sales calls,
      interviews, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      This demo shows the platform in action. Once you upload a file, the
      platform will analyze it and display what we call
      <strong>conversation fingerprint</strong> — a visual representation of the
      conversation, showing detected behaviors and emotions of the participants.

    <p>
      And below the fingerprint, you can see a summary of the conversation with
      detailed breakdown of detected behaviors and emotions of the participants.
