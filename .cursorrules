# Commit Message Guidelines

When generating commit messages, follow these rules:

## Format

- Keep subject line concise: maximum 72 characters
- Start with a capital letter

## Examples of Good Commit Messages

- "Add dark mode toggle to settings"
- "Fix audio player pause behavior"
- "Update IDS color variables"
- "Refactor transcript clip component"
- "Fix responsive layout for mobile"

# Transitions on hover

On hover, animation should always be instant; only when hover is lost should there be a transition of 0.5s

# CSS Guidelines

Always write CSS with nesting. Use nested selectors instead of flat class names.

# Plan Guidelines

When creating plans, always write them in Russian language.

# Typography Guidelines for English Text

When working with English text, use proper typographic characters:

- Use curly quotes for quotation marks: “ and ” (not straight quotes: " and ")
- Use curly apostrophe: ’ (not straight apostrophe: ')
- Always replace straight quotes (", ", ') with their typographic equivalents in English text
